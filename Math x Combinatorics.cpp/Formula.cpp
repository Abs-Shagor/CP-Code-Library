1.sum of all number between 1 to n = (n*(n+1))/2

2. sum of all even number  between 1 to n = (n*(n+2))/4   [ here, n is even ]

3. sum of all odd number between 1 to n = (n/2)^2    [ here, n is even ] 

4. sum of 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + â€¦..+ n^2 = (n*(n+1))/2 *  ((2n+1))/2

5. if the difference of 2 consecutive number of a series is same ,then		Here,
   The nth term of the series ,  T(n) = a+(n-1)*d				a = first term
   The sum of the 1st nth term , S(n) = (n/2)*(a+l) or (n/2)*(2a+(n-1)d)	d = difference

6. if the ratio of 2 consecutive number of a series is same ,then		r = ratio(2nd/1st)
   The nth term of the series , T(n) = a*r^(n-1)				l = last term
   The sum of the 1st nth term, S(n) = (a*(r^n-1)/(r-1)
